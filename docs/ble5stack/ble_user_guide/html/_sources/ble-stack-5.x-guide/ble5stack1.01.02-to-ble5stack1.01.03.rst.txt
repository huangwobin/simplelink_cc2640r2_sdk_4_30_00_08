BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 to BLE5-Stack 1.01.03
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 to
a BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.01.03. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 into the BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 example if additional tasks were added in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.02 project.

#. There has been a bug fix in the sample application code to avoid potential memory corruption. The needed 
   code changes are shown below. It's recommended to take a look at ``simple_peripheral.c`` from BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 project
   if you find this confusing.

   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_charValueChangeCB``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);``
   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_keyChangeHandler``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);``
   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_advCallback``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);``   
   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_pairStateCb``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);``   
   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_passcodeCb``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);`` 
   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_connEvtCB``, replace ``ICall_freeMsg(pValue);`` with ``ICall_free(pValue);`` 

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.
