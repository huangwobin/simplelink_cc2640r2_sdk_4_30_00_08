BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 to BLE5-Stack 1.01.04
========================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 to
a BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.01.04. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 example project that contains your target project's base functionality.

    For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

    In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
    BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 into the BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 example project.

    In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 were moved into
    simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 example if additional tasks were added in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.03 project.

#. There has been a bug fix in the sample application code where an incorrect number
of parameters were being passed into a function

   - Inside ``SimplePeripheral_processGapMessage``, in any call to ``GapAdv_disable``,
     remove all parameters except for the first parameter (handle)

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS examples included with |SDK|.

    For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 1.01.04 uses TI-RTOS see
