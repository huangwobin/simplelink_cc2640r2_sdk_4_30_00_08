Generic Access Profile (GAP)
----------------------------

The GAP layer of the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack is
responsible for connection functionality. This layer handles the
access modes and procedures of the device including device
discovery, link establishment, link termination, initiation of
security features, and device configuration. See :ref:`gap_state_diagram` for
more details.

.. _gap_state_diagram:

    GAP State Diagram.

Based on the role for which the device is configured, :ref:`gap_state_diagram`
shows the states of the device. The following describes these states.

-  **Standby**: The device is in the initial idle state upon reset.

-  **Advertiser**: The device is advertising with specific data letting
   any initiating devices know that it is a connectable device (this
   advertisement contains the device address and can contain some
   additional data such as the device name).

-  **Scanner**: When receiving the advertisement, the scanning device
   sends a scan request to the advertiser. The advertiser responds
   with a scan response. This process is called device discovery.
   The scanning device is aware of the advertising device and can
   initiate a connection with it.

-  **Initiator**: When initiating, the initiator must specify a peer
   device address to which to connect. If an advertisement is
   received matching that address of the peer device, the initiating
   device then sends out a request to establish a connection (link) with the
   advertising device with the connection parameters described in
   :ref:`connection_parameters`.

-  **Slave/Master**: When a connection is formed, the device functions
   as a slave if it is the advertiser and a master if it is the initiator.

Bluetooth devices operate in one or more GAP roles based on the application use
case. The GAP roles utilize one or more of the GAP states.
Based on this configuration, many Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack events
are handled directly by the main application task and sometimes routed from the
GAP Bond Manager. The application can register with the stack to be notified of
certain events.

.. _gap_roles:

GAP Roles
^^^^^^^^^

Based on the configuration of the device, the GAP layer always operates in one
of four (4) roles as defined by the specification:

-  **Broadcaster** - The device is an advertiser that is non connectable.

-  **Observer** - The device scans for advertisements but cannot initiate
   connections.

-  **Peripheral** - The device is an advertiser that is connectable and operates as
   slave in a single link-layer connection.

-  **Central** - The device scans for advertisements and initiates
   connections and operates as a master in a single or multiple
   link-layer connections.

The |CORESPEC| allows for certain combinations of multiple roles, which are
supported by the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack. For configuration of the
Bluetooth Low Energy stack features, see :ref:`creating_custom_ble_app`

.. note::
    Bluetooth 5 also introduces new features including Extended Advertising. Bluetooth 5
    supports legacy advertising maintaining backwards compatibility with previous versions.
    The following sections will describe how to operate the device for various GAP roles along with
    how to use the new Extended Advertising features with the new APIs.

The following sections will describe how to use the LE Advertising Extension
feature. As its name suggests, the amount of advertising data that can be sent
over the air has been extended from 31 bytes to 1650 bytes. Also multiple
advertising sets can be created using a mix of legacy and extended
advertisements. Extended advertisements introduces use the secondary
advertising channels which uses the data channels to send extensive data in
addition to the primary advertising channels (Ch. 37, 38, and 39) used in
legacy advertisement.

GAP Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Periodic Advertisement feature is not supported in this release.
* GAP Scanner can only scan one PHY per scanning cycle.
* The data length of the advertising data and the scan response data for
  Extended Advertising is limited to 1650 bytes. The connectable undirected
  advertising data is limited to 212 bytes. The connectable directed advertising
  data is limited to 206 bytes. For more information, refer to the Host Advertising Data section
  ([Vol 6], Part B, Section 2.3.4.9) of the |CORESPEC|.


.. _gap-advertiser:

GAP Advertiser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application and profiles can directly call GAP API functions to perform
Bluetooth Low Energy-related functions such as advertising or connecting.
The GAP layer functionality is mostly defined in library code. The
function headers can be found in :ble_api:`gap.h`. The advertising specific
implementation is found in :ble_api:`gap_advertiser.h`. Most of these functions
can be called directly.

The GAP Advertiser module lets you create advertisement sets. The application
can then enable and disable the sets. This way, the application can quickly
change the advertisement parameters and advertisement data. For example, an
application can create an advertisement set for legacy advertising and one for
long range advertising. If both sets are enabled, the application advertises
both on the primary advertising channels with legacy advertising, and on a LE
Coded PHY with the long range set. With long range advertising, more advertising data can
be sent and connections can be formed from larger distances compared to legacy advertising.

.. note::
  The advertisement data is de-coupled from the advertisement sets, so multiple
  sets can use the same advertisement data.

Multiple active advertising sets can set different advertising intervals. The 
figure below illustrate how two advertising sets with different interval are 
scheduled. The intervals does not need to be multiples of each other. In the 
examples the advertising interval can be set in the ``.primIntMin`` and 
``primIntMax`` Advertisement Params (``GapAdv_params_t``) member before the 
advertisement set is enabled or during advertising as described in 
:ref:`gap-changing-adv-param`.

      advParams2.primIntMax = 800; // 500 ms

    Multiple AE Advertising sets with different interval.

The following list describes how to configure the GAP layer for
advertising. The *simple peripheral* example project will be used as an example.

.. _sbp_gap_configuration_example:

#. **Create Advertisement set with** :ble_api:`GapAdv_create`. The return value
   of :ble_api:`GapAdv_create` is a handle for the advertisement set. The create
   function takes a :ble_api:`GapAdv_params_t` variable, so the first thing to do
   is to create this variable.
   **The Tx Power of legacy advertisements cannot be individually set.**
   
   *Note: The advertisement set creation can be done using SysConfig.*
   
   Some :ble_api:`GapAdv_params_t` variables are defined in
   :ble_api:`gap_advertiser.h`. In this example we will use one of
   them, ``GAPADV_PARAMS_LEGACY_SCANN_CONN``. You can of course define your own
   :ble_api:`GapAdv_params_t` variable or modify an existing :ble_api:`GapAdv_params_t`
   variable.

       status = GapAdv_create(&SimplePeripheral_advCallback, &advParamLegacy, &advHandleLegacy);

#. **Set Advertiser's virtual address set with** :ble_api:`GapAdv_setVirtualAdvAddr`.
   The handle for the advertisement set, returned from :ble_api:`GapAdv_create`, can 
   also be used to create a custom private address for that advertisement set. This
   allows different advertising sets to have different addresses. This is only 
   applicable for legacy non-connectable and non-scannable advertising sets.
   
   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple\_peripheral.c :: SimplePeripheral\_processGapMessage() :: GAP\_DEVICE\_INIT\_DONE\_EVENT** - Set advertiser's virtual address
     :linenos:

       // Set virtual address
       status = GapAdv_setVirtualAdvAddr(advHandleLegacy, &bdAddr);

#. **Load Advertisement and Scan Response data**. Advertising and scan response
   data is decoupled from the advertising set. That is, it is possible for multiple
   advertising sets to use the same memory for advertising\/scan response data. An
   advertising set could also use the same memory for its advertising and scan
   response data. (Note that this requires diligence as there are some data types
   that are only allowed once in the advertisement and scan response data. See the
   `Bluetooth Core Specification Supplement (CSSv7) <https://www.bluetooth.com/
   specifications/bluetooth-core-specification>`_ for specifics.)

   If your advertisement set is not scannable, you can of course skip the last step
   (load scan response data). Example advertising and scan response data is shown
   in :numref:`sp_advertdata` and :numref:`sp_scanrspdata`

   case ``SimplePeripheral_advCallback()``).

                                     GAP_ADV_EVT_MASK_START_AFTER_ENABLE |
                                     GAP_ADV_EVT_MASK_END_AFTER_DISABLE |
                                     GAP_ADV_EVT_MASK_SET_TERMINATED);

#. **Enable advertising.** Calling :ble_api:`GapAdv_enable` will start
   advertising.

     :linenos:

        // Enable advertising
        status = GapAdv_enable(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_ENABLE_OPTIONS_USE_MAX , 0);

The above steps can be repeated to create multiple advertising sets. There is an
upper limit of six advertising sets (defined in the controller). The heap may
also restrict the number of advertising sets you can create in one application.

.. _gap-changing-adv-param:

Changing advertising parameters
*******************************
In order to change an individual parameter after advertising has been enabled,
advertising must first be disabled. Re-enable advertising after the parameter is modified.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Changing advertising parameter during advertising.
  :linenos:

     // Stop advertising
     GapAdv_disable(advHandleLegacy);

     // Set a parameter
     uint32_t newAdvInt = 200;
     GapAdv_setParam(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_PARAM_PRIMARY_INTERVAL_MIN, &newAdvInt);

     // Re-enable advertising
     GapAdv_enable(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_ENABLE_OPTIONS_USE_MAX , 0);

Ending Advertisement
********************
An advertising set can be disabled with :ble_api:`GapAdv_disable` and deleted
(such that all memory related to the set is freed) with :ble_api:`GapAdv_destroy`.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Stop advertising and free memory.
  :linenos:

    // Stop advertising
    GapAdv_disable(advHandleLegacy);

    // Free all data related to advertising set (besides advertising / scan response data).
    // Note that this can be called while advertising is still enabled
    GapAdv_destroy(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_FREE_OPTION_DONT_FREE);

The advertising and scan response data is statically allocated and is thus not
freed as part of :ble_api:`GapAdv_destroy`.

Updating Advertisement/Scan Response Data
*****************************************
Again, since the advertising and scan response data is decoupled from the
advertising set, it is possible for multiple advertising sets to use the same
memory for advertising\/scan response data. An advertising set could also use
the same memory for its advertising and scan response data.  The memory used for
advertising\/scan response data is referred to as a "buffer" throughout this
section.

The preferred and safest method to update a buffer is to use the prepare\/load
latching mechanism. This will ensure the following:

- No buffer is freed if it is used by another advertising set.
- Advertising is always disabled before the buffer is modified, thus ensuring
  that no corrupted advertisement packets are transmitted.
- Prevent double-copying.

The following offers several ways to update the advertising and scan response
data.

Update the Advertising\/Scan response Data of a Single Handle
#############################################################

If the application wants to modify a few bytes of advertising\/scan response data
that is used by a single advertisement set, use :ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle`
and :ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByHandle`.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Update the advertising buffer of a single handle.
  :linenos:

    // Don't free anything since we're going to use the same buffer to re-load
    GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_FREE_OPTION_DONT_FREE);

    // Sample buffer modification
    advertData[3] = 0xAA;

    // Reload buffer to handle
    GapAdv_loadByHandle(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_DATA_TYPE_ADV, ADV_DATA_LEN, advertData);

The GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle() will perform the following here:

- Check that this buffer isn't used by other handles. If
  :ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle` returns success, the application will
  know that it can now safely modify this buffer.
- Automatically disable advertising and mark it for re-enabling

:ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByHandle` will automatically re-enable advertising with the
updated buffer. This method can also be used to use a subset of the original
advertising data. In this case, simply update the data length parameter of
:ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByHandle`.

Load a New Buffer to a Single Advertising Handle
################################################

If the application wants to load a new buffer to a single advertising handle
without double-copying, use :ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle` and
:ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByHandle`. This way, the advertising data exists in only one
place in memory that is used by the GAP Advertiser. In this case we will free the buffer and
allocate a new one.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Load a new advertising buffer for a single handle.
  :linenos:

    // Free the buffer (to avoid double copying) since we're loading a new buffer
    GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_FREE_OPTION_ADV_DATA);

    // Allocate new buffer (and then fill it as desired)
    uint8_t *advertData2= ICall_malloc(ADV_DATA2_LEN);

    // Load the new buffer to the advertisement set handle
    GapAdv_loadByHandle(advHandleLegacy, GAP_ADV_DATA_TYPE_ADV, ADV_DATA2_LEN, advertData2);

:ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle` will perform the following here:

- Check that the buffer isn't used by any other advertisement handles. If
  :ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByHandle` returns success, the application will
  know that it can now safely modify this buffer.
- Automatically disable advertising and mark it for re-enabling
- Free the original buffer

The :ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByHandle` will automatically re-enable advertising on
the handle with the new buffer.

Update Advertising\/Scan Response Data that is Used for Multiple Advertising Handles
####################################################################################

This is the case where the application wants to modify a few bytes of
advertising or scan response data that is shared among advertisement sets.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Update an advertising buffer used by multiple handles.
  :linenos:

    // Don't free anything since we're going to use the same buffer to reload
    GapAdv_prepareLoadByBuffer(advertData, FALSE);

    // Sample buffer modification
    advertData[3] = 0xAA;

    // Reload the buffer to be used by the advertisement set handles
    GapAdv_loadByBuffer(ADV_DATA_LEN, advertData);

:ble_api:`GapAdv_prepareLoadByBuffer` will automatically disable advertising for
all advertising handles that use this buffer. :ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByBuffer`
will automatically re-enable advertising for all handles that use this buffer.

Load a New Buffer To Multiple Advertising Handles
#################################################

This is the case where the applications wants to load a new buffer to all
advertisement set handles that are using this buffer.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Load new advertising buffer for multiple handles.
  :linenos:

    // Free buffer (to avoid double copying) since we're loading a new buffer
    GapAdv_prepareLoadByBuffer(advertData, TRUE);

    // Allocate new buffer (and then fill as desired)
    uint8_t *advertData2= ICall_malloc(ADV_DATA2_LEN);

    // Reload the buffer to be used by all the handles
    GapAdv_loadByBuffer(ADV_DATA2_LEN, advertData2);

:ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByBuffer` will perform the following here:

- Automatically disable advertising and mark it for re-enabling on all handles
  that use this buffer
- Free the original buffer

:ble_api:`GapAdv_loadByBuffer` will automatically re-enable advertising on all
handles that used the original buffer.

Directly Manipulating a Buffer While Advertising is Enabled
***********************************************************

Since the application owns the advertising and scan response buffers and thus has access to
the memory where the buffers are stored, there is nothing preventing it from directly
modifying this memory. While discouraged, there are scenarios where this can
be useful, such as updating the data after each advertisement in the most power-efficient
manner. The main drawback to this is that there is no way to guarantee that this update
won't occur while an advertising packet is being transmitted that is using this buffer,
potentially resulting in a corrupted advertising packet. This is especially true if
multiple advertising sets are using the same buffer. If the application accepts the risk
of potentially corrupting an advertising packet, there is a recommended way to do this with
minimized risk.

The buffer should be updated directly in the advertising callback (in the stack context)
when the ``GAP_EVT_ADV_END`` is received. Generally, it is recommended to
minimize processing in these callbacks and, instead, to post an event to process
in the application context. It should be noted that any processing in the stack
context has the potential to break the timing of the controller. This should not
be a problem if the only processing is to update the buffer. Also, for both this
reason and because it will lead to a semaphore that never gets posted due to
calling an ICall API from the stack context, it should be noted that no stack
API calls can be made from the stack context. To reiterate for clarity, no BLE-Stack APIs
can be called from the callback (stack) context.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Directly update advertising data in stack context.
  :linenos:

    // Callback passed into GapAdv_create(). This code is running in the stack context.
    static void SimplePeripheral_advCallback(uint32_t event, void *pBuf, uintptr_t arg)
    {
      // Advertisement just ended so it should be safe to update buffer here
      // without corrupting an advertisement.
      if (event == GAP_EVT_ADV_END)
      {
         advertData[3] = 0xAA;
      }
    }

Note that this can not be guaranteed to work all the time without corrupting an
advertisement. Also, if the buffer is used by multiple advertisement handles, the
application would need to track the ``GAP_EVT_ADV_ENDs`` across all of these handles to
find an ideal time to update the buffer. If this processing is added to the callback
in the stack context, this increases the risk of breaking the timing of the
controller. Also, remember to include ``GAP_EVT_ADV_END`` in the event mask
passed in :ble_api:`GapAdv_setEventMask`.

.. _gap_limited_advertising:

Limited Advertising
*******************
The above code sets the advertising interval for limited and general
advertising modes. By default, the peripheral advertises in general
discoverable mode. To use limited discoverable mode, the
corresponding fields inside the advertising data packet should be
changed by defining ``DEFAULT_DISCOVERABLE_MODE`` to
``GAP_ADTYPE_FLAGS_LIMITED``. The application is responsible for setting the advertising
data and advertising duration.

.. _gaprole_peripheral_role:

GAP Peripheral
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The peripheral role is demonstrated in simple_peripheral.c and
simple_peripheral.h. The Peripheral role demonstrates the use of the advertising and
connection states. The steps to use this role are as follows:

#. Initialize the GAP parameters. This initialization should occur in the
   application initialization function, for example in ``SimplePeripheral_init``
   as shown below.

   .. _gaprole_init:

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_peripheral.c :: SimplePeripheral_init()** - Setup of the GAP Peripheral Role
     :linenos:

      // Configure GAP
      {
        uint16_t paramUpdateDecision = DEFAULT_PARAM_UPDATE_REQ_DECISION;

        // Pass all parameter update requests to the app for it to decide
        GAP_SetParamValue(GAP_PARAM_LINK_UPDATE_DECISION, &paramUpdateDecision);
      }

#. Initialize the application task for the Peripheral Role and register to
   receive GAP events.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_peripheral.c :: SimplePeripheral_init()** - Initialize the GAP layer and register for GAP events.
     :linenos:

        //Initialize GAP layer for Peripheral role and register to receive GAP events
        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_PERIPHERAL, selfEntity, addrMode, NULL);

#. Now you can send commands from the application. The following is an example
   of the application initiating PHY change using :ble_api:`HCI_LE_SetPhyCmd`.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_peripheral.c :: SimplePeripheral_setPhy()** - Changing the PHY
     :linenos:

       // Send PHY Update
       HCI_LE_SetPhyCmd(connHandle, allPhys, txPhy, rxPhy, phyOpts);

   The following shows the software flow when the user chooses to set the PHY preference
   from the terminal in simple\_peripheral example:

   .. uml::
       :caption: Context Diagram of Application Updating PHY.
       :align: center

       @startuml
       participant Application
       participant "BLE Stack"

       group Connected to a device

       group User presses button to initiate PHY change
         Application -> Application: Button ISR
       end

         rnote over Application
          Button handler calls
          application callback
         end note

         Application -> Application : SimplePeripheral_doSetConnPhy()
         Application -> Application : SimplePeripheral_setPhy()
         Application -> "BLE Stack" : HCI_LE_SetPhyCmd()

         "BLE Stack" -> Application : return(status)

         group Receive HCI Event
           "BLE Stack" -> Application : SimplePeripheral_processStackMsg

           rnote over "Application"
            HCI_GAP_EVENT_EVENT -> HCI_LE_EVENT_CODE -> HCI_BLE_PHY_UPDATE_COMPLETE_EVENT
           end note

           rnote over "Application"
            Display changed PHY
           end note
         end
       end

       @enduml

   As shown in the diagram above, the actual PHY change is returned asynchronously and is
   passed to the application with event code HCI_BLE_PHY_UPDATE_COMPLETE_EVENT.

#. The application task processes most of the GAP-related events passed to it
   from the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack. For example, when a link is

GAP Scanner
^^^^^^^^^^^

The GAP Scanner performs Extended Scanning and Legacy Scanning operations as
defined by the |CORESPEC|. It controls the Scanner GAP state (see
:ref:`gap_state_diagram`). The Central and Observer role uses the scanning
state implemented by the GAP Scanner. The GAP Scanner is demonstrated in the
*simple central* and *simple observer* example projects. See the
:ref:`ble_api_reference` for the full GAP Scanner API including commands,
configurable parameters, events, and callbacks. The steps to use this module are
listed in the following, along with example code from *simple central*.

#. **Start a Central or Observer GAP role.** In this case we will use the GAP
   Central role.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_init()** - Initialize the GAP central role.

       // Initialize GAP layer for Central role and register to receive GAP events
       GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_CENTRAL, selfEntity, addrMode, NULL);

#. **Set up a callback function for scanner events and register to**
   :ble_api:`gap_advertiser.h`. Since the callback (in this
   case ``SimpleCentral_scanCb()``) is called from the stack, as little processing
   as possible should happen in it.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Initialize the GAP central role.

       // Register callback to process Scanner events
       GapScan_registerCb(SimpleCentral_scanCb, NULL);

#. **Set which events to pass to application.**

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Set which events to pass to the callback function.

       // Set Scanner Event Mask
       GapScan_setEventMask(GAP_EVT_SCAN_ENABLED | GAP_EVT_SCAN_DISABLED |
                               GAP_EVT_ADV_REPORT);

#. **Set scan parameters.** It's worth noting that the parameters are split into
   PHY-related parameters (set with :ble_api:`GapScan_setPhyParams`) and
   non-PHY-related parameters (set with :ble_api:`GapScan_setParam`). Remember
   to set both.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Set PHY-related GAP scanner parameters.

       // Set Scan PHY parameters
       GapScan_setPhyParams(DEFAULT_SCAN_PHY, SCAN_TYPE_ACTIVE,
                            SCAN_PARAM_DFLT_INTERVAL, SCAN_PARAM_DFLT_INTERVAL);

   Set which advertising report fields to send to the application (to the callback function, in this case ``SimpleCentral_scanCb()``).

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Set GAP scanner parameter.

         // Set Advertising report fields to keep
         temp16 = SC_ADV_RPT_FIELDS;
         GapScan_setParam(SCAN_PARAM_RPT_FIELDS, &temp16);

   Enable filter to remove duplicate advertising reports.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Set GAP scanner parameter.

         // Set LL Duplicate Filter
         temp8 = SCAN_FLT_DUP_ENABLE;
         GapScan_setParam(SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DUP, &temp8);

   Set which PHY to scan on.

   .. code-block:: c
     :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_processGapMsg() :: GAP_DEVICE_INIT_DONE_EVENT** - Set GAP scanner parameter.

         // Set Scanning Primary PHY
         temp8 = DEFAULT_SCAN_PHY;
         GapScan_setParam(SCAN_PARAM_PRIM_PHYS, &temp8);

   Set scan filter to filter by PDU type.

   .. code-block:: c

         // Set PDU type filter -
         // Only 'Connectable' and 'Complete' packets are desired.
         // It doesn't matter if received packets are
         // Scannable or Non-Scannable, Directed or Undirected,
         // Scan_Rsp's or Advertisements, and whether they are Legacy or Extended.
         temp16 = SCAN_FLT_PDU_CONNECTABLE_ONLY | SCAN_FLT_PDU_COMPLETE_ONLY;
         GapScan_setParam(SCAN_PARAM_FLT_PDU_TYPE, &temp16);

#. **Start scanning**. Remember to reset the number of scan results every time
   you start scanning.

   .. code-block:: c

     // Scanning for DEFAULT_SCAN_DURATION x 10 ms.
     // The stack does not need to record advertising reports
     // since the application will filter them by Service UUID and save.

     // Reset number of scan results to 0 before starting scan
     numScanRes = 0;
     GapScan_enable(0, DEFAULT_SCAN_DURATION, 0);

   The return status from the protocol stack call of :ble_api:`GapScan_enable`
   indicates only whether or not the attempt to perform device discovery was
   successful. The actual device discovered is returned asynchronously as a
   ``SC_EVT_ADV_REPORT`` forwarded through the GAP Scanner callbacks
   registered by the application (here: ``SimpleCentral_scanCb()``). This is
   described below.

#. The GAP Scanner performs some processing on the GAP events it
   receives from the protocol stack. The task also forwards some events
   to the application. :numref:`cd_gap_dev_disc` shows this and how the
   ``SC_EVT_ADV_REPORT`` is processed from the protocol stack to the
   application.

       end

       end

       @enduml

Note that during scanning, individual advertisements and scan responses are
returned as ``SC_EVT_ADV_REPORT``.This is defined by the |CORESPEC|. By
default, duplicate reports are filtered such that only one event is returned to
the application per peer device BDA. This can be configured via the
:ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DUP` GAP Scanner parameter.
``SC_EVT_SCAN_ENABLED`` indicates the start of scanning. After the scan
has completed, a summary of discovered reports will be returned to the
application with ``SC_EVT_SCAN_DISABLED``. You can see the implementation
of this in ``SimpleCentral_processAppMsg()``.

The maximum amount of scan responses that can be discovered during one scan can
be set with the ``DEFAULT_MAX_SCAN_RES`` parameter that is passed into the ``maxNumReport``
parameter of :ble_api:`GapScan_enable`.

In an environment saturated with advertisements and scan responses, this can have
a drastic impact on heap usage to the point of potentially breaking the stack.
Therefore, it is essential to profile your application for the worst-case
scenario where the maximum amount of scan responses are discovered during a scan.

You can change scanning parameters with :ble_api:`GapScan_setParam`. Note that some scanning parameters will not be updated before scanning has been disabled and re-enabled. This is true for the following parameters:

  - :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_PDU_TYPE` - Filter by PDU Type
  - :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_MIN_RSSI` - Filter by Minimum RSSI
  - :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DISC_MODE` - Filter by Discoverable Mode
  - :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_RPT_FIELDS` - Advertising Report Fields

Advertising Report Recording
****************************

In addition to the advertising report, the advertising report recording feature can be used
to record only a certain part of the Advertising Report information without the data payload.
The application can specify which fields of the Advertising Report information by using
GapScan_setParam() with the parameter ID SCAN_PARAM_RPT_FIELDS and the associate bitmap.
This is useful in the use case where the application is not interested in the payload of
Advertising Reports thus doesn't want to get GAP_EVT_ADV_REPORT event from GAP Scanner but
needs some specific information such as address type, address, RSSI, etc.. To prepare
recording, GAP Scanner allocates necessary amount of memory in GapScan_enable().
Then whenever GAP Scanner gets a new packet, it puts only the specified fields of the
information in the Advertising Report List in packed form. The list is kept in RAM even
after the scanning ends until the application calls GapScan_discardAdvReportList()
or a new scanning starts. While the list is available, the application can retrieve the
information by using GapScan_getAdvReport(). When the list gets full, GAP Scanner issues
SCAN_EVT_ADV_REPORT_FULL to the application to notify that no more Advertising Report
information will be recorded. How many Advertising Reports' information have been recorded
can be found in the numReport field of the data buffer of type GapScan_Evt_End_t,
coming with GAP_EVT_SCAN_END event. Alternatively, if the application didn't mask
GAP_EVT_SCAN_END and doesn't get it, GapScan_getParam() with parameter
ID SCAN_PARAM_NUM_ADV_RPT can be used.


Filtering
*********

The GAP Scanner module provides 5 different types of filter to reduce the amount of advertising
report notifications to the application and eventually save memory and power consumption.
The result of the filtering affects both advertising reports and advertising report recording.
The packets filtered out by the filter configurations are discarded and will
neither be reported nor recorded. The filters are set by using the API
:ble_api:`GapScan_setParam` with the following parameter IDs:

- :ref:`cd_gap_filter_policy`: :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_POLICY`
- :ref:`cd_gap_filter_type`: :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_PDU_TYPE`
- :ref:`cd_gap_filter_rssi`: :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_MIN_RSSI`
- :ref:`cd_gap_filter_discoverable`: :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DISC_MODE`
- :ref:`cd_gap_filter_duplicates`: :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DUP`.

All parameter IDs are described in the following sections. The GAP Scanner
allows the application to apply any combination of the individual filters at the
same time to narrow the scope of packets to receive.

.. _cd_gap_filter_policy:

Filter by LL Filter Policy
##########################

This filter is a link layer-level filter. The associated parameter ID used in
:ble_api:`GapScan_setParam` is :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_POLICY`. The parameter
accompanying :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_POLICY` is passed to the link layer when
:ble_api:`GapScan_enable` is called before actually enabling scanning. Since the filtering
is done by the link layer, the application only receives advertising report events
that have passed the filter. The parameter value can be one of the following:

+-------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                          | Value   | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |

+-------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _cd_gap_filter_type:

Filter by PDU Type
##################

This filter is based on the ``Event_Type`` parameter coming with the LE Extended
Advertising Report Event. The associated parameter ID is
``SCAN_PARAM_FLT_PDY_TYPE``. The parameter value specifies packets
classified in six categories:

- Connectable/Non-Connectable
- Scannable/Non-Scannable
- Directed/Undirected
- ScanRsp/Adv
- Legacy/Extended
- Complete/Incomplete.

Every incoming packet has exactly one attribute in each category. For example,
:ble_api:`SCAN_FLT_PDU_NONSCANNABLE_ONLY` and
:ble_api:`SCAN_FLT_PDU_SCANNABLE_ONLY` cannot be chosen together since they
represent scannable and non-scannable packets. Only either one can be used. If
neither type is selected in a set, the filter will not care about that category.
For example, if neither :ble_api:`SCAN_FLT_PDU_NONCONNECTABLE_ONLY` nor
:ble_api:`SCAN_FLT_PDU_CONNECTABLE_ONLY` is set in the parameter value, the GAP
Scanner will notify the application of both connectable packets and
non-connectable packets. It will also record both connectable packets and
non-connectable packets. The ``SCAN_PARAM_FLT_PDY_TYPE`` parameter value
can be any combination of the following individual values (except individual
values that are mutually exclusive):

+----------------------------------------+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                                   | Value    | Description                                                                               |

.. _cd_gap_filter_rssi:

Filter by Minimum RSSI
######################

This filter is based on the RSSI parameter coming with the LE Extended
Advertising Report Event. The associated parameter ID used in
:ble_api:`GapScan_setParam` is :ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_MIN_RSSI`. The GAP
Scanner will discard LE Extended Advertising Report Event whose RSSI parameter
value is smaller than the minimum RSSI value given by the application. The
available range is -128 dBm to 127 dBm.

.. _cd_gap_filter_discoverable:

Filter by Discoverable Mode
###########################

This filter is based on the ``Flags AD`` type value in the payload (in
the ``Data`` parameter) of the LE Extended Advertising Report Event. The
associated parameter ID used in :ble_api:`GapScan_setParam` is
:ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DISC_MODE`. This filter is applied after the GAP
Scanner reassembles all the fragmented payloads delivered by multiple LE
Extended Advertising Report Events. The GAP Scanner will discard the
defragmented packet if the found Flags AD type value doesn't match the parameter
value given by the application. The parameter value can be one of the following:

+----------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                       | Value   | Description                                                               |

+----------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _cd_gap_filter_duplicates:

Filter by Duplicates
####################

Like the Link Layer Scanner Filter Policy, this filter is a link layer-level filter.
The associated parameter ID used in :ble_api:`GapScan_setParam` is
:ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DUP`. The parameter accompanying the
:ble_api:`SCAN_PARAM_FLT_DUP` parameter ID is passed to the link layer when
:ble_api:`GapScan_enable` internally calls ``LE_SetExtScanEnable`` to
enable scanning. Since the filtering is done by the link layer, GAP Scanner
receives only the LE Extended Advertising Report Events that have passed the
filter. The parameter value can be one of the following:

+---------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                      | Value   | Description                                               |

+---------------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

.. _gapinitiator:

GAP Initiator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initiator module is used to initiate the connection to a peripheral device.
An initiator generally scans for advertisements then connects to a specific
device. The initiator is a short lived state that transitions to the Master
Role after a connection is established.
Unlike the GAP Advertiser and GAP Scanner modules, GAP Initiator doesn't have
any callback function to call or to be called.

Only a device initiated with the GAP Central Role can become an initiator.

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: **simple_central.c :: SimpleCentral_init()** Setup of Central Role
    :linenos:

    void SimpleCentral_init(void)
    {
        // Register with GAP for HCI/Host messages (for RSSI)
        GAP_RegisterForMsgs(selfEntity);

        // Initialize GAP layer for Central role and register to receive GAP events
        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_CENTRAL, selfEntity, addrMode, NULL);
    }

The following API is used to initiate connection to a peer device, see
:ble_api:`GapInit_connect`

.. code-block:: c
    :caption: Initiating connection in Central Role
    :linenos:

    GapScan_Evt_AdvRpt_t advRpt;

    GapScan_getAdvReport(index, &advRpt);

    /*
     * The initiating timeout is in milliseconds and will automatically cancel
     * connection initiation if the peer is not connected. This can be set to
     * 0 to wait indefinitely.
     */
    uint16_t initTimeout = 500;

    GapInit_connect(advRpt.addrType & MASK_ADDRTYPE_ID,
                  advRpt.addr, DEFAULT_INIT_PHY, initTimeout);


If the on-going connection attempt is intended to be canceled by either timeout
or a user request (the application calling :ble_api:`GapInit_cancelConnect`),
the stack notifies the application of the cancellation completion with a
:ble_api:`GAP_CONNECTING_CANCELLED_EVENT`.

The initiator task will use the parameters saved for the PHY specified in the
call to :ble_api:`GapInit_connect`. These may be set with
:ble_api:`GapInit_setPhyParam`. Defaults are shown in ``gap_initiator.h``

GAP Central
^^^^^^^^^^^

The GAP Central role is demonstrated in simple_central.c and simple_central.h. The Central
role demonstrates the use of the scanning and initiating states and supports connections
to peripheral devices. See the simple\_central example project for an example of
implementing the Central role. The steps to use this module are as follows.

#. Initialize the GAP and GATT parameters.
   This initialization should occur in the application
   initialization function (for example in ``SimpleCentral_init``).
   GAP parameters can also be set in this initialization function.

   .. code-block:: c

     static void SimpleCentral_init(void)
     {
       // Initialize GATT Client
       VOID GATT_InitClient();
       ...
       // Accept all parameter update requests
       GAP_SetParamValue(GAP_PARAM_LINK_UPDATE_DECISION, GAP_UPDATE_REQ_ACCEPT_ALL);
     }

#. Start the GAP Central role and register to receive events in the application task.

   .. code-block:: c

        // Initialize GAP layer for Central role and register to receive GAP events
        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_CENTRAL, selfEntity, addrMode, NULL);

.. _connection_parameters:

GAP Connection State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A BLE device can be either in the Master (Central) or Slave (Peripheral) role in
the Connection State. The following are relevant parameters for the both roles
in the Connection State.

Connection Parameters
*********************

This section describes the connection parameters which are sent by
the initiating device with the connection request and can be
modified by either device when the connection is established. These
parameters are as follows:

-  **Connection Interval** - In Bluetooth Low Energy connections, a
   frequency-hopping scheme is used. The two devices each send and
   receive data from one another only on a specific channel at a
   specific time. These devices meet a specific amount of time later
   at a new channel (the link layer of the Bluetooth Low Energy
   protocol stack handles the channel switching). This meeting is
   where the two devices send and receive data is known as a
   ``connection event``. If there is no application data to be sent or
   received, the two devices exchange link layer data to maintain
   the connection. The connection interval is the amount of time
   between two connection events in units of 1.25 ms. The connection
   interval can range from a minimum value of 6 (7.5 ms) to a
   maximum of 3200 (4.0 s). See :ref:`gap_connection_event` for more details.

    Connection Event and Interval

Different applications may require different connection intervals.
As described in :ref:`connection_parameter_considerations`, these requirements
affect the power consumption of the device. For more detailed information on
power consumption, see the `Measuring Bluetooth Smart Power Consumption Application Report (SWRA478) <http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/swra478>`_.

-  **Slave Latency** - This parameter gives the slave (peripheral)
   device the option of skipping a number of connection events. This
   ability gives the peripheral device some flexibility. If the
   peripheral does not have any data to send, it can skip connection
   events, stay asleep, and save power. The peripheral device
   selects whether to wake or not on a per connection event basis.
   The peripheral can skip connection events but must not skip more
   than allowed by the slave latency parameter or the connection
   fails. See :ref:`slave_latency` for more details.

    Slave Latency

-  **Supervision Time-out** - This time-out is the maximum amount of
   time between two successful connection events. If this time
   passes without a successful connection event, the device
   terminates the connection and returns to an unconnected state.
   This parameter value is represented in units of 10 ms. The
   supervision time-out value can range from a minimum of 10 (100
   ms) to 3200 (32.0 s). The time-out must be larger than the
   effective connection interval (see :ref:`effective_connection_interval` for
   more details).

.. _effective_connection_interval:

Effective Connection Interval
*****************************

The effective connection interval is equal to the amount of time
between two connection events, assuming that the slave skips the
maximum number of possible events if slave latency is allowed (the
effective connection interval is equal to the actual connection
interval if slave latency is set to 0).

The slave latency value represents the maximum number of events that
can be skipped. This number can range from a minimum value of 0
(meaning that no connection events can be skipped) to a maximum of
499. The maximum value must not make the effective connection
interval (see the following formula) greater than 16 s. The interval
can be calculated using the following formula:

 ``Effective Connection Interval = (Connection Interval) * (1 + [Slave Latency])``

Consider the following example:

-  Connection Interval: 80 (100 ms)

-  Slave Latency: 4

-  Effective Connection Interval: (100 ms) * (1 + 4) = 500 ms

When no data is being sent from the slave to the master, the slave
transmits during a connection event once every 500 ms.

.. _connection_parameter_considerations:

Connection Parameter Considerations
***********************************

In many applications, the slave skips the maximum number of
connection events. Consider the effective connection interval when
selecting or requesting connection parameters. Selecting the correct
group of connection parameters plays an important role in power
optimization of the Bluetooth Low Energy device. The following list
gives a general summary of the trade-offs in connection parameter
settings.

Reducing the connection interval does as follows:

-  Increases the power consumption for both devices
-  Increases the throughput in both directions
-  Reduces the time for sending data in either direction

Increasing the connection interval does as follows:

-  Reduces the power consumption for both devices
-  Reduces the throughput in both directions
-  Increases the time for sending data in either direction

Reducing the slave latency (or setting it to zero) does as follows:

-  Increases the power consumption for the peripheral device
-  Reduces the time for the peripheral device to receive the data sent
   from a central device

Increasing the slave latency does as follows:

-  Reduces power consumption for the peripheral during periods when the
   peripheral has no data to send to the central device
-  Increases the time for the peripheral device to receive the data sent
   from the central device

Connection Parameter Limitations with Multiple Connections
**********************************************************

There are additional constraints that exist when connected to
multiple devices or performing multiple GAP roles simultaneously.
See the multi_role example in |STACKVER|.


Connection Parameter Update
***************************

In some cases, the central device requests a connection with a
peripheral device containing connection parameters that are
unfavorable to the peripheral device. In other cases, a peripheral
device might have the desire to change connection parameters in the middle of a
connection, based on the peripheral application. The peripheral
device can request the central device to change the connection
parameters by sending a ``Connection Parameter Update Request``.
For Bluetooth 4.1, 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1-capable devices, this request is handled directly by
the Link Layer. For Bluetooth 4.0 devices, the L2CAP layer of the
protocol stack handles the request. The Bluetooth Low Energy stack
automatically selects the update method.

The ``Connection Parameter Update Request`` contains four parameters:

- minimum connection interval
- maximum connection interval
- slave latency
- connection time-out.

These values represent the parameters that the peripheral device wants for
the connection. The connection interval is given as a range. When
the central device receives the ``Connection Parameter Update Request`` request,
it can accept or reject the new parameters.

Sending a ``Connection Parameter Update Request`` is optional and it is not
required for the central device to accept or apply the requested
parameters. Some applications try to establish a connection at a
faster connection interval to allow for a faster service discovery
and initial setup. These applications later request a longer
(slower) connection interval for optimal power usage.

Regardless of the role (peripheral or central), connection parameter updates can
be sent asynchronously with the :ble_api:`GAP_UpdateLinkParamReq` command. The
simple\_peripheral application can be configured to automatically send a
parameter update a certain amount of time after establishing a connection. For
example, the simple\_peripheral application uses the following symbols, defined
in ``simple_peripheral.c``:

.. code-block:: c

    #define DEFAULT_DESIRED_MIN_CONN_INTERVAL     80
    #define DEFAULT_DESIRED_MAX_CONN_INTERVAL     800
    #define DEFAULT_DESIRED_SLAVE_LATENCY         0
    #define DEFAULT_DESIRED_CONN_TIMEOUT          1000
    #define SP_SEND_PARAM_UPDATE_DELAY            6000

In simple\_peripheral, six seconds after a connection is established the application
automatically sends a GAP Update Link Parameter Request:

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: **simple_peripheral.c :: SimplePeripheral_processParamUpdate()** - Initiating parameter update request
  :linenos:

    static void SimplePeripheral_processParamUpdate(uint16_t connHandle)
    {
      gapUpdateLinkParamReq_t req;
      req.connectionHandle = connHandle;
      req.connLatency = DEFAULT_DESIRED_SLAVE_LATENCY;
      req.connTimeout = DEFAULT_DESIRED_CONN_TIMEOUT;
      req.intervalMin = DEFAULT_DESIRED_MIN_CONN_INTERVAL;
      req.intervalMax = DEFAULT_DESIRED_MAX_CONN_INTERVAL;

      // Send parameter update
      bStatus_t status = GAP_UpdateLinkParamReq(&req);

When the peer device receives this update request, the GAP parameter
:ble_api:`GAP_PARAM_LINK_UPDATE_DECISION` determines how it responds. See
:ref:`gaprole_peripheral_role` for an explanation of how the parameters are
configured.

Connection Termination
**********************

Either the master or the slave can terminate a connection for any
reason. One side initiates termination and the other side must
respond before both devices exit the connected state. Use the
:ble_api:`GAP_TerminateLinkReq` command to terminate an existing connection.
