Porting From EasyLink 2.40.3 to EasyLink 2.50.1
=================================================

EasyLink 2.40.3 is bundled with the SimpleLink |DEVICEAND| **2.40** SDK. EasyLink 
2.50.1 is bundled with the SimpleLink |DEVICEAND| **3.10** SDK. 

For this migration guide, the rfEasyLinkTx project will be ported from EasyLink 
2.40.3 to EasyLink 2.50.1. The steps should be transferable for any EasyLink 
example project. 

Because the directory structure is nearly identical between the two releases, the 
recommended approach is to start with a EasyLink 2.50.1 project that contains the 
same base functionality as the porting target project and merge in any custom 
functionality. 

#. Choose a EasyLink 2.50.1 example project that contains your target projectâ€™s 
   base functionality. 

   For this example, we will use rfEasyLinkTx as the starting EasyLink 2.50.1
   example project. 

#. Transfer all modified application files from EasyLink 2.40.3 into the EasyLink 
   2.50.1 example project.

   In this example, the following files from EasyLink 2.40.3 were moved into 
   rfEasyLinkTx EasyLink 2.50.1 example:

		* ``rfEasyLinkTx.c``
		* ``smartrf_settings`` files

#. Configure the default address.

   In EasyLink 2.50.1 there are two new parameter in ``easylink_config.h`` called 
   EASYLINK_USE_DEFAULT_ADDR and EASYLINK_DEFAULT_ADDR. Thier usage is documented 
   in  ``easylink_config.h``
