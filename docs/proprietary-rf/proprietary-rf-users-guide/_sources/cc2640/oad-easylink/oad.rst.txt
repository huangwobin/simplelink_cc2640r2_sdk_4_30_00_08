Over the Air Download (OAD)
===========================

This section serves as a guide to the Texas Instruments Over-the-Air Download
(:term:`OAD`) ecosystem. :term:`OAD` is a device firmware upgrade method that
allows the firmware image running on a device to be updated over the air using
a proprietary RF connection while providing power loss protection.

The :term:`OAD` guide section will cover:

    - :term:`OAD` theory of operation and architecture
    - How to run the :term:`OAD` examples included in the |SDK|
    - How to add :term:`OAD` to an existing sample application

The supported development kit for :term:`OAD` is a launchpad. To follow the
procedures listed in this guide, two launchpad development kits are required.
