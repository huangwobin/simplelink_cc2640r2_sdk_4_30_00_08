Running Software Examples on CC2640R2L
======================================

The `CC2640R2F LaunchPad`_ development board can be used for evaluation and
software development for the `CC2640R2L`_ device. The `CC2640R2L`_ is pin
compatible with the `CC2640R2F`_ device.

The `CC2640R2L`_ is functionally identical to the `CC2640R2F`_ except the
following hardware peripherals are not included in the `CC2640R2L`_:

* Sensor Controller Engine
* Comparators
* Constant Current Source

Because the Sensor Controller is not available on the `CC2640R2L`_, the AUX RAM
can be used freely by the application. This provides an additional 2KB of
memory available to the application. For more information on how to configure
the AUX RAM for use by the application, see :ref:`using-the-aux-as-ram`.

Porting Software Examples for CC2640R2L
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run `CC2640R2F`_ software examples that do not utilize the Sensor
Controller on the `CC2640R2L`_  without making any changes.

For applications that do utilize the Sensor Controller to control peripherals,
such as the ADC for example, please utilize TI drivers to interface with the
peripherals and implement control logic in the application. For more
information on utilizing TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel Users Guide`_ and
`Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.
