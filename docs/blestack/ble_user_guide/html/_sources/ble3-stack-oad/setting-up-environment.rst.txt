Setting up the BLE OAD Environment
==================================

This section will cover the steps required to setup a BLE OAD environment.

The BLE OAD topology is described below. Refer to
:numref:`fig-oad-downloader-and-target` for a review of the devices involved in
an OAD.

    - OAD Distributor: BTool connected to Host Test on |LP|.
    - OAD Target: BLE sample application (``simple_peripheral``)
      with OAD functionality enabled.

 .. note::
    TI provides mobile applications that support OAD, these are outside of
    the scope of the OAD guide. Refer to the Quick Start Guide for more
    information.

Prerequisites
-------------

This section requires the following hardware and software components

 - 2x |LP|
 - |SDK| installed
 - Uniflash_

OAD Target Setup
----------------

In order to perform a BLE OAD, an OAD capable image must be loaded onto the OAD
target device. This section will cover the steps required to load the |LP|
with an OAD enabled BLE image.

    #. Navigate to the ``simple_peripheral_oad_offchip`` or
       ``simple_peripheral_oad_onchip`` folder inside the |STACK|.

    #. Import the project into the workspace of your selected IDE.

        - See the Quick Start Guide for instructions on how to work with your
          selected IDE.

    #. Select the proper build configuration based on security needs:

        - ``FlashROM``: will use security and is the default configuration

        - ``FlashROM_unsecure``: will not use security

        - Be sure that all projects configurations are in sync. If one
          ``_unsecure`` project is used, all other projects should use the
          unsecure flavor as well.

        - Based on the project configuration, the proper version of the
          :ref:`sec-oad-tools` will be used. If security is enabled the
          signature is automatically added to the image.

    #. (on-chip OAD only) Build and flash the persistent app project

        - **The build steps must be done in order, or errors will occur**

    #. Build and flash the stack project directly in the IDE

    #. Build and flash the app project using UNIFLASH

        - Flash the `_oad.bin` image that is produced
          by the oad\_image\_tool or the device will not boot after a reset.

        - The `_oad.bin` file contains CRC and (if applicable) security
          information about the image. This is used by the BIM on boot to
          determine which image to run. **If the image is flashed directly
          from the IDE, the device will not boot after subsequent resets
          as either CRC or security information is missing** See 
          :ref:`sec-loading-a-release-image` for more information.

    #. Build and flash the BIM project directly in the IDE

        - The BIM ``DEBUG`` option(Project Settings -> Build -> ARM Compiler ->
          Predefined Symbols: DEBUG) will disable CRC checks on the image 
          (for off-chip), making it possible to flash an image straight from 
          the IDE.

        - If your device does not boot, it is likely that you have either 
          forgotten to load the app project (_oad.bin) through uniflash or there 
          might be different build configurations (secure/unsecure) for the 
          bim/app/persistent/stack, see :ref:`sec-loading-a-release-image` for 
          more info.

    #. Verify the device has booted up and is advertising

        - Verification: Open a terminal window with 115200 8N1 to the
          ``XDS110 Class Application/User UART`` port corresponding to your
          |LP|.

        - The console should display the text below, use it to get the BLE
          address. Note that this text may be different between on and off-chip
          OAD, but the concept is the same.

        .. _fig-sbp-oad-boot-screen:

        .. figure:: resources/sbp_oad_boot_screen.png
            :align: center

    #. Alternatively, you can get the BLE address of the device using UNIFLASH.

        - See the screenshot below for how to do this in UNIFLASH.

        .. _fig-verify-bdaddr-uniflash:

        .. figure:: resources/verify_bdaddr_uniflash.png
            :align: center

    #. Plug/unplug the device to prevent :ref:`sec-oad-bim-hib`

        - If the device does not advertise after reset, ensure the
          `_oad.bin` file was loaded.

OAD Distributor Setup
---------------------

As per the :ref:`sec-oad` section, the OAD Distributor is the device
responsible for fragmenting an OAD enabled image in to chunks of OAD blocks and
sending each block over the to the OAD Target device as they are requested.

In the case of BLE, the OAD Distributor is a combination of BTool running on
the PC connected to host_test running on a |LP|. host\_test is a BLE
enabled network processor application. BTool is a PC tool that is capable of
interfacing to host_test and performing various BLE functions in addition to
OAD. For more information, refer to the ``host_test`` README file or the BTool
User's Guide.


Flashing the host_test Image
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

See below for the steps to setup the host\_test image on a |LP|.

    #. Navigate to ``hexfiles`` folder within the |STACK|.

    #. Select the ``host_test_*.hex`` file.

    #. Flash the above hexfile using UNIFLASH. See image below

Connecting BTool to host\_test
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

BTool and host\_test communicate via USB through the XDS110 UART back channel.
See below for a diagram

        +--------------+         +--------------+         +--------------+

    #. Find the port used by the UART backchannel of the |LP| running
       host\_test. This is the one with the name ``XDS110 Class
       Application/User UART``

    #. Open BTool (see the BTool executable in the tools folder of the |STACK|)

    #. Use the following serial port settings, hit OK

        - Port: <PORT_FROM_ABOVE_STEP>

        - Other settings: 115200 8N1

    #. This should open and initialize the host\_test device.

    #. Pressing the scan button should populate a list of devices in the log

        - A screenshot of a properly initialized BTool session is shown below
