Creating a Production Image
===========================

A production image is an image that is ready for flashing at the factory, and to
be released in a commercial OAD enabled product.

Disable DEBUG Define in Project Setting.
----------------------------------------

By default, the DEBUG feature in the BIM is disabled. This can be enabled 
during development and for evaluation of the TI OAD solution, but is not 
recommended for a production OAD build as it will bypass CRC checks on the 
application image.

If ``DEBUG`` is defined in the Compiler Predefined Symbols (Project Settings -> 
Build -> ARM Compiler -> Predefined Symbols) the Off-Chip BIM  will not check 
the CRC of the image before booting. This removes a layer of redundancy in the 
system in favor of allowing the developer to load an OAD image straight from the 
IDE. The On-Chip OAD BIM does not skip the CRC check, but if the application is 
loaded directly from the IDE with invalid CRC in the header, the BIM will on 
boot invalidate the crc status (crcstat = CRC_INVALID) and jump into the 
persistent application.

In order to disable the debug fatures in the BIM, disable the DEBUG define:

 - ``xDEBUG``


Device Trim
-----------

It may be desirable to remove the secondary device trim in the
application for production images. See :ref:`sec-oad-bim-trim` for more
information.


Secure OAD: Change default keys
-------------------------------

If you are using the secure version of OAD, new OAD keys should be generated
and stored on the device. It is a security risk to use the placeholder keys that
are provided with TI as these are publically available.

See :ref:`sec-gen-security-keys` for more information on how to generate and
install new keys on the device. If using unsecure OAD, this step is not
necessary.

Create Merged Production Image
------------------------------

.. _SimpleLink Academy Enhanced OAD Module for SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK: http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FSimpleLink%20CC2640R2%20SDK

Please refer to Task 4 â€“ Bonus: Creating a Production Image in 
`SimpleLink Academy Enhanced OAD Module for SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK`_ to learn 
how to creata a merged production image that contain BIM, Application, Stack 
and the Persistent Application (On-chip only).


Loading a Production Image
--------------------------

Images loaded straight from the IDE will not have a valid
CRC or signature. However, the oad\_image\_tool will add the CRC
and signature automatically at the completion of each build. Refer to
:numref:`fig-oad-downloader-and-target` for a diagram of the build process.

.. warning::
    If flashing the BIM image (or a merged image containing BIM) using uniflash,
    be sure that the ``Keep CCFG data`` box is not checked. (Settings &
    Utilities --> Download). BIM will use a custom CCFG, so it is important that
    any existing image on the device is removed. Another safeguard is the mass
    erase the device before starting with OAD.

It is necessary to load the device using the ``*_oad.bin`` application file 
that is output by the oad\_image\_tool using UNIFLASH.

    - The binary from the tool will be placed in the build folder alongside the
      default ``.out`` file.

The address offset should be 0x0000000 as shown in the screen capture below

Note the following error is benign and can be ignored for OAD images. Verify the
device has booted correctly by verifying the terminal output.
