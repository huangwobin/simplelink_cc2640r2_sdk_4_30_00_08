Performing a BLE OAD
====================

This section will detail the steps required to perform an OAD over BLE using
BTool. It assumes that the OAD Target and Distributor have been setup according
to :ref:`sec-ble-oad-setup`.

.. warning::

    If the device is connected to an external debugger when performing an OAD,
    the device could potentially not reset properly after a successfull OAD.
    This is a known issue, however, simply unplugging/replugging or hard reset
    the device will make the device boot properly. Read more about this in
    detail in Section :ref:`sec-oad-bim-hib`.

.. _sect-modify-image-version:

Modifying the Image Version
---------------------------

Modifying the image version is a quick and easy way to verify that the OAD has
completed. Some sample apps will display their image version in the terminal
window.

#. Navigate to the ``oad_image_header*.c`` file in the SDK.
#. Modify the ``SOFTWARE_VER`` field to increase the version number
#. Rebuild the application project, and generate a new binary ``*_oad.bin``.

    - The oad\_image\_tool automatically runs as a post-build step
    - The binary from the tool will be placed in the build folder alongside the
      default ``.out`` file.

OAD using BTool
---------------

    #. Run BTool using the ``Run_BTool.bat`` script, this will initialize BTool
       to use the proper BLE-Stack version.

    #. Connect to the target device using its BLE address

        - See steps in :ref:`sec-ble-oad-target-setup` for steps to get
          target address

        - Screen shot below shows how to connect to a specific BLE address in
          BTool

    #. Wait for the application's connection parameter update (if enabled)

        BTool will send a connection parameter update at the
        beginning of an OAD to attempt a faster download. The embedded application
        will also attempt a parameter update. It is recommended to wait until the
        application's connection parameter update has taken place before starting
        an OAD. If you are experiencing a slow OAD, this may be the cause. The
        parameter update is complete once the following message is shown in the
        BTool log:

        .. code-block:: none

            --------------------------------------------------------------------


    #. Once connected, switch to the OAD tab and load an oad image into BTool

        - If using on-chip OAD, be sure to un-check the box "OAD to external
          flash"

        - The OAD process has begin once the image identify is accepted.

        - While intermittent blocks are being sent BTool will display:
          ``Write Block Number = x of y``

        - The OAD process will continue until BTool displays
          ``OAD Download Successful``.

        - The "secure" checkbox is read-only and indicates whether the currently
          loaded OAD image has security enabled in its header.

        - For secure OAD configurations, BTool uses the default public/private
          key pair. To change the security keys used by the embedded device, see
          :ref:`sec-gen-security-keys`. To change the security keys used by
          BTool please see the next section of this chapter.

        .. warning::

            After the OAD procedure has completed, you may need to manually
            unplug/replug or hard reset the |LP| in order to trigger a
            full reset and jump to BIM. This is a known issue, and is
            described in more detail in Section :ref:`sec-oad-bim-hib`.

        - After some delay (copying in the BIM), the new image should boot up
          and will be active.

        .. _fig-btool-oad:

    #. Assuming the steps in :ref:`sect-modify-image-version` were followed,
       then a new image version # should be be observed on the terminal display.
       If the version displayed on the terminal matches, then the download
       has has completed successfully.

        .. figure:: resources/oad_verify_version.png
            :align: center

.. note::
    The :ref:`sec-oad-tools` will run as a post build step to build an OAD
    enabled image. The output of the tool is a bin file with ``_oad.bin``
    appended to the name of the input hex file. This is the file to pass into
    BTool.

BTool Image Header Dialog
-------------------------

A good way to inspect and parse the fields in the :ref:`sec-oad-image-header`,
for a given image is to use BTool. In this view, BTool will parse the various
fields in the image header and present them in a human readable format.

This can also be used to manually change various fields of the image header
and then resign/recalculate the CRC. The image header dialog can be used to
modify the image version number in order to simulate upgrading to a new version
of the firmware via OAD.

When using secure OAD, any change in the image header will require the image to
be re-signed as well as CRC to be recalculated. Resigning the image requires
the key files to be placed in the same folder as `BTool.exe`.
Copy the ``public.pem`` and ``private.pem`` files from the
``tools/blestack/oad`` folder into the same folder as ``btool.exe``.

.. note::

    It is important that the keys match the ones that are installed on the
    embedded device or the image signed by BTool will be rejected due to an
    invalid signature.

You can access the OAD Image Header dialog using the following steps:

  #. Start BTool normally
  #. Navigate to the "Over The Air Download" pane
  #. Select read image file, point this to the candidate image ending with
     `_oad.bin`
  #. Click the image header button
