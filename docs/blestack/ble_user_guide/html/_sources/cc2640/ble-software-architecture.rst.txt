Software Architecture
=====================

The TI royalty-free Bluetooth Low Energy software development kit (SDK) is a
complete software platform for developing single-mode Bluetooth Low Energy
applications. This kit is based on the SimpleLink |DEVICE|, complete
System-on-Chip (SoC) Bluetooth Low Energy solution. The |DEVICE| combines a
2.4-GHz RF transceiver, 128-KB in-system programmable memory, 20KB of SRAM, and
a full range of peripherals. The device is centered on an Arm\ |reg|
Cortex\ |reg|-M3 series processor that handles the application layer and
Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack and an autonomous radio core centered on an
Arm Cortex\ |reg|-M0 processor that handles all the low-level radio control
and processing associated with the physical layer and parts of the link layer.
The Sensor Controller block provides additional flexibility by allowing
autonomous data acquisition and control independent of the Cortex-M3 processor,
further extending the low-power capabilities of the |DEVICE|. For more
information about the |DEVICE|, see the |TRM|.

.. note::
    The Sensor Controller is not available on the CC2640R2L_.

|STACK| Protocol Stack and Application Configurations
-----------------------------------------------------

Above the RF driver is the TI Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack, which is
implemented in library code.

The application developer interfaces with the protocol stack through a set of APIs
(ICall) to implement a Bluetooth Low Energy application. The rest of this
document intends to document application development on the |DEVICE| using the
Bluetooth Low Energy stack.

:numref:`fig-device-configurations` shows the platform that supports two
different protocol stack and application configurations.

-   **Single device:** The controller, host, profiles, and application are all
    implemented on the |DEVICE| as a true single-chip solution. This
    configuration is the simplest and most common when using the |DEVICE|. This
    configuration is used by most of TI's sample projects. This configuration is
    the most cost-effective technique and provides the lowest-power performance.

-   **Simple network processor:** The Simple Network Processor (:term:`SNP`)
    implements the controller and host layers of the |STACK|. Additionally,
    the SNP exposes an interface for scheduling communication between the stack
    and an external MCU. This accelerates dual MCU designs because the
    application processor (:term:`AP`) is only responsible for managing custom
    profiles and application code. Stack-related functionality, such as
    security, is implemented on the SNP. The SNP currently supports the
    peripheral and broadcaster GAP roles. Communication with the SNP is carried
    out through the SNP API. The SNP API is built on the Unified Network
    Processor Interface (:term:`UNPI`), which supports UART and SPI transport
    layers. For more information, reference the
    :ref:`npi-unified`. TI also provides the SAP library, which implements a
    UNPI master and the SNP API. The SAP library can be ported to any
    TI-RTOS-capable processor, or used as a reference for developing a custom
    dual MCU solution. For a description of the SNP, see the README.html page
    within the simple_np folder, advanced users can read the
    `SNP API Reference`_ for a summary of the supported
    commands.

    Single-Device Processor and Simple Network Processor Configurations

Solution Platform
-----------------

This section describes the various components that are installed with
|STACKVER| and the directory structure of the protocol stack
and any tools required for development.
:numref:`fig-single-network-processor-configuration` shows the |STACK|
development system.

.. _fig-single-network-processor-configuration:
.. figure:: resources/image8.jpeg
    :align: center

    Bluetooth Low Energy Stack Development System

The solution platform includes the following components:

-   **TI's Real-Time Operating System (TI-RTOS)** with the TI-RTOS kernel,
    optimized power management support, and peripheral drivers (SPI, UART, and
    so forth)

-   **CC26xxware DriverLib** provides a register abstraction layer and is used
    by software and drivers to control the |DEVICE| SoC.

-   **The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack** is provided in library form with
    parts of the protocol stack in the |DEVICE| ROM.

-   **Sample applications and profiles** make starting development using both
    proprietary and generic solutions easier.

The following integrated development environments (IDEs) are
supported:

-  IAR Embedded Workbench for Arm

-  Code Composer Studio™ (CCS)

Refer to the SDK release notes for the specific IDE versions supported by this
release.

BLE Software Architecture
-------------------------

The |DEVICE| Bluetooth Low Energy software environment consists of the
following parts:

-  An application image with the TI-RTOS kernel, drivers and Bluetooth profile
-  A stack image or library that implements Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

TI-RTOS is a real-time, pre-emptive, multithreaded operating system that
runs the software solution with task synchronization. Both the application and
Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack exist as separate tasks within the RTOS. The
Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack has the highest priority. A messaging
framework called indirect call (ICall) is used for thread-safe synchronization
between the application and stack. :numref:`fig-examples-software-architecture`
shows the architecture.

.. _fig-examples-software-architecture:
.. figure:: resources/image43.jpeg
    :align: center

    Example Software Architecture

-   The stack image includes the lower layers of the Bluetooth Low Energy
    protocol stack from the LL up to and including the GAP and GATT layers. Most
    of the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack code is provided as a library.

-   The application image includes the RTOS, profiles, application code,
    drivers, and the ICall module.

Protocol Stack Build Configurations
-----------------------------------

The |STACK| applications have different options for configuring the protocol
stack to maximize system implementations. These options are described below
along with the relevant advantages and limitations.

.. note::

      This section aims to explain the two supported protocol stack build
      configurations. Additionally, the protocol stack itself may be configured
      to conditionally pull in different library builds based on the features
      needed. Configuring the protocol stack is covered in
      :ref:`stack_features_configuration`



.. _sec-inc-architecture-stack-image-as-a-library:

Stack Library Configuration (``_stack_library``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In |STACKVER|, stack can be built as a library that can be statically linked
to the application. Projects with build with this new configuration can be
identified by project build configurations with ``_stack_library`` in its
configuration name. Using this build configuration will yield additional flash
footprint optimizations by the linker since the application and stack can share
contiguous flash pages. The gained footprint savings will however prevent
**split-image** application. See
:ref:`tbl-inc-developing-in-ccs-build-configs` and
:ref:`tbl-inc-developing-in-iar-build-configs` for the available project build
configurations. Stack library projects have the following properties

    - Stack project generates a static library (.lib)
    - Application project will now link the stack in as a library
    - There is no explicit app/stack boundary. The application's link step
      decides the memory locations of the code within the stack_library. There
      are some exceptions to this such as :term:`SNV`.
    - This architecture saves flash by allowing the linker work more efficiently.
    - These projects used the improved ICall architecture


Covert Library Build to Split Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To covert the Stack_library build projects into split image, please visit `Task 2-Add OAD
to Multi Role` in BLE Enhanced OAD section in
**SimpleLink Academy** `www.ti.com/simplelinkacademy <http://ti.com/simplelinkacademy>`_

.. _sec-inc-architecture-split-image-configuration:

Split Image Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with previous BLE-Stack releases, application and stack images are
built as two separate projects that generate two separate images.
These images occupy separate, non-overlapping flash memory pages. The split image
configuration is useful in purposes such as  :term:`OAD` where it could
be advantageous to perform independent application or stack downloads. Split
image projects have the following properties:

    - Fixed stack entry point
    - Stack project generates a separate executable (.hex, .out, .bin)
    - Explicit Flash/RAM boundaries between app and stack
    - Independent update of stack/app (API compatibility must be ensured by the
      user)

Project Build Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample applications within the |STACK| portion of the |SDK| support multiple
build configurations to enable using the protocol stack build types discussed
above. Other build configurations may have been created to support features such
as RCOSC or OAD out of the box.
The table below gives a summary of the build configurations found within
|STACK| and their compatibility with one another.

      However the principles of the table above can still be applied. Always
      consult the ``README.html`` file of the specific sample application for
      more information on it's supported build configurations. Additionally,
      refer to :ref:`tbl-inc-developing-in-ccs-build-configs`

.. _sec-inc-architecture-standard-project-task-hierarchy:

Standard Project Task Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Considering the simple\_peripheral project as an example, these tasks are listed
by priority. A higher task number corresponds to a higher priority task:

-   Priority 5: Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack task (must be highest priority)
-   Priority 1: Application task (simple\_peripheral)

:ref:`sec-tirtos-overview` introduces TI-RTOS tasks.
:ref:`sec-ble-stack-overview` describes interfacing with the Bluetooth low
energy protocol stack. :ref:`start-up-in-main` describes the application task.

Directory Structure
-------------------

The default install location is: *C:\\ti\\simplelink\_cc2640r2\_sdk\_x\_xx\_xx\_xx*.

The SDK installs to this location by default. For the purposes of this document,
consider the above path to the |STACK| root directory; it will be omitted.
All paths will be relative to the |STACK| root directory. Opening up the root

.. _sec-inc-architecture-working-with-hex-files:

Working With Hex and Binary Files
---------------------------------

|STACK| projects have project build configurations in which the application
and stack projects produce an Intel\ |reg|-extended hex file in their
respective output folders. These hex files lack overlapping memory regions and
can be programmed individually with a flash programming tool, such as SmartRF
Flash Programmer 2. To simplify the flash programming process, you can combine
the application and stack hex files into a super hex file manually or using
freely available tools.
Information on the `Intel Hex standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel\_HEX>`_.

One example for creating the super hex file is with the IntelHex python script
hex\_merge.py, available at `IntelHex launchpad <https://launchpad.net/intelhex/+download>`_.
To merge the hex files, install Python\ |reg| 2.7.x and add it to your system
path environment variables.

.. warning::

    Note that when using any python script, you must use a compatible version
    of Python. Refer to the tool documentation or contact the developer to
    verify compatibility.

The following is an example usage to create a merged
simple\_peripheral\_cc2640r2lp.hex file consisting of the individual application
and stack hex files:

If conversion of the super hex to binary is desired, this can be accomplished
with the “hex2bin.py” or similar tools that support the hex standard.

    Resetting the |DEVICE|
    ----------------------

    Use only hard resets to reset the device. From software, a reset can occur
    through one of the following.

    .. code-block:: c

        HCI_EXT_ResetSystemCmd(HCI_EXT_RESET_SYSTEM_HARD);
        HAL_SYSTEM_RESET();
