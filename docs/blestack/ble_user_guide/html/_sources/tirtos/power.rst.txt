Power Management
----------------

All power-managment functionality is handled by the TI-RTOS power driver and
are used by the peripheral drivers (e.g. UART, SPI, I2C, etc..). Applications
can prevent, if they choose, the |DEVICE| from entering low power modes by
setting a power constraint.

More information on power-management functionality, see `Power Management
User's Guide`_. These APIs are required only when using a custom driver.

.. ifconfig:: doctarget in ['ble2', 'ble3', 'ble5']

    With |STACK| applications, the power contraint is set in ``main()`` by
    defining the ``POWER_SAVINGS`` preprocessor symbol. When defined,
    enabled, the device enters and exits sleep as required for |STACK| events,
    peripheral events, application timers, and so forth. When undefined, the
    device stays awake.

    Also see *Measuring Bluetooth Smart Power Consumption* (SWRA478) for steps to
    analyze the system power consumption and battery life.
