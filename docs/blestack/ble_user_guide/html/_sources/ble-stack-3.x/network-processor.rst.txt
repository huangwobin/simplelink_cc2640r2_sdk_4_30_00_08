This page will describe how to use the |LP| as a Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) wireless network processor. A wireless network processor (:term:`NP`)
setup is a dual MCU solution, where an external MCU such as the MSP432 manages
the Bluetooth application layer (Profiles and Services) and sends commands to
the
|LP| BLE wireless MCU over a serial interface. In the NP
configuration, the BLE Host and Controller protocol stack elements reside on
the wireless MCU.
Adding BLE to your existing MCU quickly enables IoT capability in an existing
closed/cabled design.

.. note::

    A Network Processor is not the same as an HCI LE Controller-only
    configuration, such as supported by CC2564 and WiLink8 controllers.
    The |LP| wireless MCU does not support a standalone LE
    Controller-only configuration since the TI BLE Stack (Host and Controller)
    executes on the |LP|.

Serial Interface (NPI)
======================

The serial connection between the Application Processor (:term:`AP`) and Network
Processor is handled through TI's Network Processor Interface (NPI). NPI is
compile time configurable and currently supports UART and SPI. There are two
versions of NPI. While they share a lot of similarities, there are important
differences that must be accounted for when developing a dual MCU solution.

To learn more about the NPI interface that each NP solution uses, please see
:ref:`sec-npi`


TI BLE Wireless Network Processor Example Projects
==================================================

TI offers two Wireless Network Processor example projects in the |STACK|
to quickly add BLE to your existing MCU/SoC architecture.
To assist with finding the right NP application for your Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) design, the table below shows some of the benefits and trade offs
associated with each NP example. These sample projects can be found under the
examples folder in the |STACK| SDK.

Simple Network Processor
------------------------

SimpleNP is for developers who want to easily add a simple and reliable BLE
interface/subsystem to an existing MCU. Using the |STACK| simple network
processor mode allows for quick and easy addition of secure Bluetooth Low Energy
wireless connectivity to any embedded system by providing a simple API (SAP)
to drive the |LP| wireless MCU from a host microcontroller.
The complete Bluetooth Low Energy controller, host and a simple network
processor interface layer resides on the |LP| wireless MCU, while a light
network processor driver library resides on an external MCU connected to
|LP| device via a standard serial connection.
Developers can leverage this mode to reuse years of technology developed on
embedded MCUs and easily add wireless connectivity to their system without going
through the learning curve of Bluetooth Low Energy wireless protocol and
software stacks.
All SNP & SAP project code is provided in full source form
(except for the core BLE Stack), so the developer can easily port or customize
these projects to work with other application processor MCUs.


To get started with the simple\_np, please download the `MSP Bluetooth Plugin`_
and do the Bluetooth SDK Plugin Lab of the  `MSP432P4 SimpleLink Academy`_

Host Test
---------

Developers should consider HostTest for developing a dual-MCU BLE solution if
they need to support the Central or multiple GAP roles and are familiar with
the HCI and Vendor-Specific (VS) HCI protocol implementation.

A combination of HCI and VS HCI commands/events form the interface to the
HostTest app from the application processor. HostTest uses NPI (non Unified
version, see link above) to send and receive raw HCI-formatted commands over the
serial interface, and pack/unpack them for the BLE stack to process. At the NPI
layer all HCI packets are queued up asynchronously. NPI primarily serves to
pack and unpack the HCI data structures into byte arrays, all HCI packets are
sent in a FIFO manner.

The HCI/HCI Vendor Specific interface is described in the
`TI Vendor Specific HCI Guide`_.
See this document for more information about the TI Vendor Specific (VS)
HCI interface.
