BLE-Stack 3.03.03 to BLE-Stack 3.03.04
======================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 to
a BLE-Stack 3.03.04.

There are little or no changes in the examples, but the method provided below 
is a general safe approach to adopt.

For this migration guide, simple_peripheral from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 will be
ported over to BLE-Stack 3.03.04. Because the directory structure is
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with
a BLE-Stack 3.03.04 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE-Stack 3.03.04 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

   For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_.

   In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
   BLE-Stack 3.03.04 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 into the
   BLE-Stack 3.03.04 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 were moved into
   simple\_peripheral BLE-Stack 3.03.04 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE-Stack 3.03.04 uses TI-RTOS see
   :ref:`sec-tirtos-overview`

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel Users Guide`_ and
   `Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.


Noteworthy Changes from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 to BLE-Stack 3.03.04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can follow the guide above without addressing these updates, they are listed
for your information only. All fine grained details might not be mentioned, 
please refer to the specific example you need to port and to a compare between 
the old and new project files. Always refer to the BLE-Stack Release Notes for 
all the details.

* It is now possible to configure active scan channels with 
  ``TGAP_SET_SCAN_CHAN`` in ``GAP_SetParamValue`` or with the new HCI command 
  ``HCI_EXT_SetScanChannels``.
