Memory Management
=================

This section aims to describe the various memory regions available on the
device as well as how they are used by the stack and application. The
chapter starts with an overview of the memory map of the device, and then each
section goes into detail on how this memory region is used.

*******************************
Developing a Custom Application
*******************************

A system designer must have a firm grasp on the general system
architecture, application, and Bluetooth Low Energy stack framework
to implement a custom Bluetooth Low Energy application. This section
provides indications and guidance on where and how to start
implementing a custom application based on information presented in
the previous sections (:ref:`the_application` and :ref:`the_stack`)
as well as knowledge of TI RTOS and |DEVICE|.

Decide what role and purpose the custom
application should have. If an application is tied to a specific
service or profile, start with that sample application. Base your project on one
of the following sample applications that implement one of the fundamental
GAP roles:

    - simple\_central

    - simple\_peripheral

    - simple\_broadcaster

    - simple\_observer

If you are using a network processor solution, please see the
:ref:`sec-network-proc` section.
