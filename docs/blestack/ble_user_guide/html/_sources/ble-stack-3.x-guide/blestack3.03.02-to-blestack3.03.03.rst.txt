BLE-Stack 3.03.02 to BLE-Stack 3.03.03
======================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE-Stack 3.03.02 to
a BLE-Stack 3.03.03.

For this migration guide, simple_peripheral from BLE-Stack 3.03.02 will be
ported over to BLE-Stack 3.03.03. Because the directory structure is
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with
a BLE-Stack 3.03.03 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

If you choose to not start with an example project from BLE-Stack 3.03.03 and
instead wish to port your project by going to Properties |rarr| General |rarr|
Products and selecting the new version of the |DEVICE| SDK that you wish to
point to, be careful to examine what files are linked and what files are copied
into your workspace from the SDK and adjust your project accordingly. For
example, if you are migrating code based on the Project Zero for the |DEVICE|, be
sure to reference the new ``ble_user_config.c``, ``ble_user_config.h`` and
board files from the target SDK. The ``ble_user_config.c`` and
``ble_user_config.h`` are linked to the project, therefore, you need to copy
those files into the new SDK.

#. Choose a BLE-Stack 3.03.03 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

   For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_.

   In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
   BLE-Stack 3.03.03 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE-Stack 3.03.02 into the
   BLE-Stack 3.03.03 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE-Stack 3.03.02 were moved into
   simple\_peripheral BLE-Stack 3.03.03 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE-Stack 3.03.03 uses TI-RTOS see
